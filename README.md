# Quotes Lab
`lab 8`

in this lab I created an application that convert a Json array into array of strings then get the quote from this array.

`lab 9`

In this lab I created a method to get a random quote from an Api on the internet and if there is no connection it will get it from the JSON file instead.

## Dependencies

* GSON

you need to install GSON into your project first by putting this code into your dependencies:

```java
dependencies {
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'
}
```
